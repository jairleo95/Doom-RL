  -Actor-Critic methods for Sonic (specifically, PPO). Very instructive reference, and in fact we are using his encoding for the doom environment. Code is included as a download and is a great deal simpler than the opanai baselines implementation: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/an-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-methods-lets-play-sonic-the-hedgehog-86d6240171d (Tue)
